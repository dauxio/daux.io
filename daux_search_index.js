If the command isn\u2019t found, ensure your $PATH contains ~\/.composer\/vendor\/bin or ~\/.config\/composer\/vendor\/bin. #Docker Or if you wish to use Docker, the start of the command will be : docker run --rm -it -p 8085:8085 -w \/build -v \"$PWD\":\/build daux\/daux.io daux Any parameter valid in the PHP version is valid in the Docker version #Writing pages Creating new pages is very easy: Create a markdown file (*.md or *.markdown) Start writing By default, the generator will look for folders in the docs folder. Add your folders inside the docs folder. This project contains some example folders and files to get you started. You can nest folders any number of levels to get the exact structure you want. The folder structure will be converted to the nested navigation. You must use underscores instead of spaces. Here are some example file names and what they will be converted to: Good: 01_Getting_Started.md = Getting Started API_Calls.md = API Calls 200_Something_Else-Cool.md = Something Else-Cool _5_Ways_to_Be_Happy.md = 5 Ways To Be Happy Bad: File Name With Space.md = FAIL #See your pages Now you can see your pages. you have two options for that : serve them directly, or generate to various formats. We recommend the first one while you write your documentation, you get a much quicker feedback while writing. #Serving files You can use PHP\u2019s embedded web server by running the following command in the root of your documentation .\/serve Upload your files to an apache \/ nginx server and see your documentation More informations here #Export to other formats Daux.io is extendable and comes by default with three export formats: Export to HTML, same as the website, but can be hosted without PHP. Export all documentation in a single HTML page Upload to your Atlassian Confluence server. See a detailed feature comparison matrix To export, run the daux command and your documentation will be generated in static (you can change the destination with the --destination option) See here for all options #Configuration Now that you got the basics, you can also see what you can configure #Server Configuration We are using .mjs file types. Which not every web server properly understands and serves. You might see an error like Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of &quot;application\/octet-stream&quot;. Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. #Apache If you are using a version under 2.5.1 of Apache HTTPd. Add the following line within .htaccess, vhost or server configuration. AddType application\/javascript .mjs #nginx include mime.types; types { application\/javascript js mjs; } #PHP Requirements Daux.io is compatible with the officially supported PHP versions; 8.4.0 and up. #Extensions Daux.io needs the following PHP extensions to work : php-mbstring and php-xml. If you use non-english characters in your page names, it is recommended to install the php-intl extension as well. #Support If you need help using Daux.io, or have found a bug, please create an issue on the GitHub repo.","tags":"","url":"Getting_Started.html"},{"title":"Admonition","text":"Table of Contents Syntax Examples Notes Info Warning Danger Notes without titles Confluence #Syntax Admonitions are created using the following syntax: !!! type &quot;optional explicit title within double quotes&quot; Any number of other indented markdown elements.

It\u2019s very easy to use because it works automatically: finds blocks of code, detects a language, highlights it. Learn more. You can even use Github Flavored Markdown We also use the scrivo\/highlight.php package to highlight on rendering when possible. Highlight.js is a powerful but heavy library, since we don\u2019t know which languages you\u2019ll use we included all of them. The good news is; if you use a fenced code block (```) with the language defined, the rendering is done on server side and entirely skips loading Highlight.js on the page.

You can create a token by following this documentation. #Where to upload Now that the connection is defined, you need to tell it where you want your documentation to be uploaded. For that you need an ancestor_id or root_id; the id of the page that will be the parent of the documentation\u2019s homepage or the page that will be the homepage of your documentation respectively. You can obtain a page\u2019s id by checking the links of the actions on the page (page information, show source code, export, etc) : the ID corresponds to the query parameter pageId. { \"confluence\": { \"ancestor_id\": 50370632 } } If using an ancestor_id you may wish to create the page automatically if it doesn\u2019t exist.

By default the threshold is 2%. Setting the value to 0 disables the feature altogether. #Delete old pages When a page is renamed, there is no way to tell it was renamed, so when uploading to Confluence, the page will be uploaded and the old page will stay here. By default, it will inform you that some pages aren\u2019t needed anymore and you can delete them by hand. { \"confluence\": { \"delete\": true } } By setting delete to true (or running daux with the --delete flag) you tell the generator that it can safely delete the pages. #Information message When you create your page. there is no indication that the upload process will override the content of the pages.

The classes must respect the PSR-4 Naming convention. And have \\Todaymade\\Daux\\Extension as a base namespace. You can copy our Processor template to get started. By default, we created a daux\/Processor.php file to get you started. #A quick test ? For the example we\u2019re just going to dump the tree and exit. public function manipulateTree(Root $root) { print_r($root-&gt;dump()); exit; } also, add this at the beginning of the file: use Todaymade\\Daux\\Tree\\Root; Let\u2019s just try if it works by running daux --processor=Processor Yes, you get a big array dump!

If you create a new ContentType, like let\u2019s say LaTeX, you would set the title My Page.tex it will keep the title My Page and use your renderer.

By doing this, you don\u2019t need to create a new theme. #config.json options Here is an example config.json file : { \"favicon\": \"&lt;theme_url&gt;img\/favicon.png\", \"css\": [\"&lt;theme_url&gt;css\/theme.min.css\"], \"js\": [], \"fonts\": [ \"https:\/\/fonts.googleapis.com\/css?family=Roboto+Slab:400,100,300,700&amp;subset=latin,cyrillic-ext,cyrillic\" ], \"variants\": { \"blue\": { \"favicon\": \"&lt;theme_url&gt;img\/favicon-blue.png\", \"css\": [\"&lt;theme_url&gt;css\/theme-blue.min.css\"] }, \"green\": { \"favicon\": \"&lt;theme_url&gt;img\/favicon-green.png\", \"css\": [\"&lt;theme_url&gt;css\/theme-green.min.css\"] } } } There are five options : favicon: The URL to your favicon css: An array of CSS Stylesheets to add to the page js: An array of JavaScript files to load fonts: An array of Font sources, these are added as stylesheets variants: An object containing sub-themes. Each sub theme, can provide the same configurations as the main theme (favicon, css, js, fonts) You will also notice this &lt;theme_url&gt; in the url. This is automatically substituted with the final url to the theme when generating the final page. There are two possible substitutions : &lt;theme_url&gt;: The url to the current theme &lt;base_url&gt;: The url to the documentation root #Theme variants Like the default Daux.io theme, you might want to provide variants of your theme. In the example before, there were two variants : blue and green. The configuration of a variant is added to the configuration of the main theme, it doesn\u2019t replace it. For example the main CSS files defined are: [&quot;&lt;theme_url&gt;css\/theme.min.css&quot;] and the green variant defines [&quot;&lt;theme_url&gt;css\/theme-green.min.css&quot;]. The final list of CSS files will be [&quot;&lt;theme_url&gt;css\/theme.min.css&quot;, &quot;&lt;theme_url&gt;css\/theme-green.min.css&quot;]. This doesn\u2019t apply to favicon, only the last value set is kept. #Setting the theme for your documentation In your documentation\u2019s config.json (not the theme\u2019s config.json) Change the theme option inside html { \"themes_directory\": \"\/home\/user\/themes\", \"html\": { \"theme\": \"{theme}-{variant}\" } } The name of the theme, is the folder name. You can use the themes_directory setting if you want to specify a custom location of your themes folder. A variant is optional, if you want to add one, separate it from the theme with a dash. #Overriding templates By default, you have a list of templates in templates You can create a folder named templates in your theme, copy-paste the original template in that folder, and you can modify it freely.
